# Introduction
Hey Reader! Welcome to this Tutorial on How to write, deploy & interact with a smart contract on Tezos in SmartPy. We will be learing a lot and having fun alongside!
You will be able to understand the industry standards of coding on SmartPy and be able to deploy your own Calculator Smart Contract whilist Understading the code as well.

- Tezos is an open-source blockchain protocol for assets and applications backed by a global community of validators, researchers, and builders. The Tezos protocol is secure, upgradable, and built to last.
- SmartPy is an intuitive and powerful smart contract development platform for Tezos and is available through a Python library for building and analyzing Tezos smart contracts.


# **Prerequisites**

You need basic understanding of Python Language. Rest all will be covered from getting XTZ from the Faucet to Coding and Deployment!


# **Requirements**

You will need to have Temple Wallet Installed in your browser. Get it [HERE](https://templewallet.com/).


# Body of the Tutorial

Points to remember:

- **Section headings like Introduction, Prerequisites, etc. *must* all be H1, keep all sub-headings at H2.**
    - In Markdown syntax, a single hashmark is used for H1 headings: #
    - Two hashmarks are used for H2 headings: ##
- Add all relevant Code Blocks, with the appropriate syntax highlighting:
    - ```text must be used for terminal output, terminal commands and plaintext.
    - ```javascript can be used for both JavaScript and Solidity, while ```jsx can be used for ReactJS code.
    - Use ```rust and ```toml when highlighting Rust or TOML syntax.
    - Use ```graphql when highlighting GraphQL
    - Use ```json when highlighting valid JSON (for invalid JSON examples, use ```text instead).
    - ```bash should *only* be used for Code Blocks where you need to have # style comments. This must be done carefully because in many situations the # character will render as a heading. If this happens it will usually wreck the Table of Contents.
- Add necessary comments in Code Blocks.
- Add any text content necessary to guide readers through your tutorial.
- Add Images or Code Blocks to reflect expected terminal output.
- Add common errors and steps to troubleshoot the errors, *for example -*

**Not able to connect to the Avalanche Node and getting error on executing `node connect.js`**

Let's check for some common causes:

- First, make sure you have the `.env` file saved and it's in the correct format as given in the tutorial.
- If you're getting an error message like `UnauthorizedError: { "message":"Invalid authentication credentials" }` then make sure to replace the `<API_KEY>` with your correct API key which you copied from the DataHub Dashboard.
- Make sure to have the `.env` file saved in your project root folder.
- Make sure `NODE_URL` in the `.env` file is correct.
- If you're still experiencing the same issue, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fszyM7K) or on the [Forum](https://community.figemnt.io/) for help.
